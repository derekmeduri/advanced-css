            Welcome to my portfolio! My name is Derek and I have been coding
            full-time for about 8 months. My interest in coding started back in
            highschool in the year 2006. I was introduced to dreamweaver and
            helped make my highschool footballs program website. After that came
            html and css coding on MySpace.
          </p>
          <p>
            Soon after I was off to college and began pursuing a career in
            fashion and programming was left behind. I graduted from Kent State
            University and moved to NYC to begin working as a Product Developer
            in Women's Handbags. After a few years in the city my wife and I
            moved to Columbus, Ohio.
          </p>
          <p>
            Back in Ohio I started watching YouTube videos on coding and
            programming. Wanting a career change I decided to take a coding
            bootcamp through The Ohio State University. Below you can see some
            of my previous projects. I am currently looking for an internship or
            an entry level position as a Junior Developer. If you have any
            questions please refer to my contact information below.
