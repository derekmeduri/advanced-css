This is the homework for week two. We are tasked with deploying a portfolio of our work for a potential employer. Our site should have a functioning nav bar that when you click the link it will take you to the corresponding section of the page. It should also include an image/avatar of the creator and an about me section, as well as examples of our past applications. The page should be responsive and adapt to different screen sizes when resized.
